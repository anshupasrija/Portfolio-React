        <p>I developed Rent A Bin app while in school as my final capstone assignment. Given 10 days, we had to come up with an idea for a web application that would solve some type of issue. I built Rent A Bin, a application that allows you to book the plastic bins for moving .

        To build this application, I used React and JavaScript, as well as CSS/SASS for my front-end.For the back-end, I used Express and Node.js.</p>
